The first time I heard about programming I was 15. My high school was proposing extracurricular class and I had the opportunity to enroll in an introduction to Pascal. Pascal? Yes, a language that probably nobody remembers anymore. When I saw I could take this class I thought it was so cool! I was so excited, over the moon. It was going to be awesome! Well- it wasn't. The teacher had obviously lost any motivation to teach, the class was noisy and we were being taught by someone whose preferred teaching method was the silent treatment. Some cool kids knew what they were doing (you know, those geeks who were programming their Texas Instruments to build "video" games during recess). The rest of us just had no clue. Exams consisted of a cool kid saving his project on a floppy (yes a floppy, google it just for fun if you don't know what it is.). And the floppy was being passed around from computer to computer. You can imagine my disappointment. I thought I would be building a bunch of fun stuff, but at the end of this class I even couldn't figure out to to simulate the coin toss. I buried my enthusiasm for learning programming and arrived at the conclusion that programming was reserved for a certain elite, specifically selected by some sort of coding Master from above. They were the chosen ones. 

I pursued a Masters Degree in Advertising, then another one in Business Management. I worked for advertising agencies and IT companies, always on the business side. I was good at my job but in every one of them I was dreaming of becoming the technical guy that I was often managing. I wanted to become the graphic designer for the agency, the software expert of Dell, the systems engineer of SAB. I wanted the technical knowledge, the thing that made them so useful. I wanted to become a technical expert, I wanted to become all of their roles. I was craving technical expertise. Crazy talk- I couldn't be all that at once... Or could I? 

In 2014 I moved to the U.S. and had no other choice than to reinvent myself. Because I wasn't satisfied of the positions I could find here, I took it as an opportunity to finally allow myself to be myself. Bye-bye Masters degrees that did little to open the gates of personal fulfillment. I was ready to start from scratch. What was out there for me? After long hours of research, I ended up on an article talking about Ruby. After some more research, I came across training to become full stack developer. Full stack developer? OMG! The graphic designer of the agency, the software expert of Dell, the systems engineer of SAB... They were all there, even the geek who was building games on his calculator! I had to give it a try. I threw myself on coding training platforms, bought books on programming, closed myself off in a little bit more in my cubicle for studying. 

That was it! After few months, I renounced to my former life and decided to go full time with coding. We had a baby on the way at that time, and right now I couldn't be happier sharing my time between my 8 month old baby boy and rubyâ€” my two gems!
